# wavenet-js

DeepMind's WaveNet... but in JavaScript!

_Work in progress - I'll try to finish it soon_

## But... why?

Well, apart from the obvious: why not? I couldn't find any WaveNet implementations in tfjs, so I decided to write one myself, mostly as a practice - I just wanted to learn how to use tfjs better and also recall stuff from a class I've taken some time ago at Stanford. But maybe somebody will find some supre niche use case for it, who knows?

Also, so I can actually do a writup that (hopefully) anybody can understand.

## Understanding WaveNet

Maybe it's just me, but I feel that most of deep learning community is absolutely terrible at explaining things, making it really difficult for new comers, especially people not yet pursuing PhD, to get into it.
